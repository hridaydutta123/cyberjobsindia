HackerCouch is "Hospitality for Hackers". To pledge your couch, you must
file a Pull Request. More detailed instructions are [here][add].

The idea isn't new, it has been [tried before][original] as well. The reason we are trying this again is:

- The idea of a Fork->PR->Merge->Publish flow with almost zero effort
- Filing a pull request is a great filter for hackers
- hackercouch.com was available
- <a data-proofer-ignore title="hackercouch.com, anyone?" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1842383">This comment</a> by @sirupsen on HN

### Credits

- The original hackercouch project: [jancborchardt/hackercouch][original]
- [remy/mit-license](https://github.com/remy/mit-license) for the fork-PR-publish workflow.
