          About Zamp: We’re on a mission to change the way the world does finance. The Problem We Are Addressing: Today, finance teams worldwide grapple with challenges of fragmentation, lack of real-time data, and manual repetitive processes. These processes are labor-intensive and time-consuming, often preventing focus on more strategic areas that could drive growth and innovation. Fragmentation stems across multiple financial partners for banking, payments, credit, and investments - and this multiplies by country for global organizations. In addition, it is not uncommon for a mid-market enterprise company to have 25+ point SaaS vendors for various finance processes (e.g. A/P, A/R, Tax, Treasury), most of which don’t integrate with each other. The need to navigate disparate systems, reconcile data from multiple sources, and manage routine tasks manually not only increases the risk of errors but also limits the teams’ ability to provide timely and insightful financial analysis. The Future of Finance: We strongly believe there’s a different way. A different way for finance teams to operate. A different way for software to be built. A different way for the world to work. We are building for a world where we enable companies to run finance on auto-pilot and scale fearlessly! We are building a financial platform for the future - one where: - Connectivity to banks, partners, and systems is in real-time. - New workflows can be built on the fly through AI, dynamically customized to each user and use case - replacing the need for fragmented, vertical SaaS solutions. - AI insights are at scale and in real-time, better than BI teams’ capability today. - AI agent bots replace all manual and repetitive work. This will make finance global, real-time, and intelligent. It will free up time and resources, and enable more informed decision-making. It will be magical - and bring back calm and joy to finance teams worldwide. Join us on this mission to change the way the world does finance!
